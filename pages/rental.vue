          Our space is great for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooking classes</li>
          <li>Private dinners</li>
          <li>Cooking-centric team building events</li>
          <li>Food photo shoots</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our space is like a kitchen playground. We have an
          enormous kitchen in an open-plan space with every
          piece of equipment you could imagine, plus plenty of
          space to eat and hang out.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll have a wide choice of possible activities, with
          multiple ovens, including a German-made "combi oven"
          with built-in humidity/steam control, commercial
          deep-fryer, and even a real wok range. We also have a
          commercial pasta extruder, ice cream machines
          (several!), chocolate-making tools, and even coffee
          roasters and an espresso machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our 1700sqft open-concept space has tall ceilings and
          lots of natural light, making it very spacious and
          comfortable. And we've designed it to be easy to
          re-arrange for different needsâ€”whether you're looking
          to have a chef come in and do a demonstration, a team
          cooking competition, a photo shoot, or something
          completely different.
