                <p>Hi, I’m Dan Mills.</p>
                <p>Food and cooking have always been a hobby for me, and I’ve always had a
                    love for kitchen equipment and the science of food. From my childhood
                    in Venezuela through my career in the tech industry I’ve slowly expanded
                    my arsenal of tastes, techniques and equipment, always tinkering with
                    something new. In 2015 I started Tinker Kitchen to build an awesome maker
                    space for food where I can share this passion with others.</p>
                <p>The seed for this concept dates back to my college days, where I had the
                    good fortune to take a very special biology course. Makerspaces weren’t
                    really a thing back then, but that’s exactly what this was: a sculptor
                    and a bio prof had a lab in the basement to explain real-world structures
                    and processes by building physical models. We studied biological
                    organisms, did research, and built models to explain them. I discovered
                    that this learning style is not only great fun, but immensely effective:
                    I can still remember the things I learned back then, even though it’s been
                    almost two decades.<a href="#" class="link"></a></p>
                <p>That is how I approach cooking as well. I am not only interested in the end
                    product, but in learning the underlying principles. And there is no better
                    way to learn than by having hands-on fun in a highly creative makerspace,
                    with all the tools you could ever dream of, and a community to lend a
                    hand.<a href="#" class="link"></a></p>
