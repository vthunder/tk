        <p>There are several ways to have a group activity at Tinker
            Kitchen! We're a perfect space for a small cooking-themed
            team offsite, dinner party, or even a larger celebration.</p>

                    <p>We can help you put together a fun
                        cooking-themed team offsite!</p>

                    <p>Note that Tinker Kitchen remains open for
                        members, but we do reserve space for the

                    <p>Tinker Kitchen staff can provide guidance, help

                        activity. Note: 1 month notice required to
                        inform our members that weâ€™ll be closed on
                        that day.</p>

                        best timing and recommended maximum (up to 40
                        people).</p>
