                <p>Although we don't allow food production at this time, we
                    <strong>are</strong> a commercial kitchen
                    facility. Whether you recently graduated from a
                    culinary degree program and are looking for a
                    place to practice your skills and try our new
                    ideas, or a serial entrepreneur looking to do
                    focused R&D and get a new product to market,
                    Tinker Kitchen is here for you.</p>

                <p>We have a network of mentors and experts that can
                    help you get to market faster. Whether you need
                    help with regulatory compliance, sourcing a good
                    vendor for an ingredient, designing packaging, or
                    making sure your green drink stays green on the
                    shelf (we hear that is difficult!)&mdash;we can
                    help connect you to the right expert.</p>

                <p>Because we're a great events space, we can also
                    host micro-popup events and classes/demos designed
                    to get customer feedback and refine your products.</p>
